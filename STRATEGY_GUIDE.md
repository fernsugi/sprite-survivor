## Game Basics

### Core Mechanics

- **Waves**: 30 seconds per wave, boss every 5 waves (5, 10, 15, 20)
- **Victory Condition**: Defeat the Wave 20 boss
- **Points**: Collect orbs to earn points, 10 points = 1 sprite summon
- **Merging**: Two sprites of the **same type AND same level** merge into one higher level sprite

### Why Merging Matters

| Level | Damage Multiplier | Range Bonus | Cooldown Reduction |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1 | 1.0x | Base | Base |
| 2 | 1.5x | +20% | -5 frames |
| 3 | 2.25x | +44% | -10 frames |
| 4 | 3.38x | +73% | -15 frames |
| 5 | 5.06x | +107% | -20 frames |

A single Lv5 sprite massively outperforms five Lv1 sprites. **Focus on merging, not diversity.**

## Tier List

| Tier | Composition | Playstyle |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| S | Ninja / Cleric / Frost | Consistent DPS, safe, beginner-friendly |
| S | Archer / Cleric / Frost | Budget, ultra-safe, longest range |
| A+ | Wizard / Cleric / Frost | Chain lightning, swarm destroyer |
| A | Bomber / Cleric / Frost | High burst, explosive AOE |
| A | Ninja / Vampire / Frost | Aggressive, dual sustain |
| B | Berserker / Cleric / Frost | Spin-to-win, risky but fun |
| B | Knight / Cleric / Frost | Melee brawler, high risk |

---

## S-Tier Compositions

### Ninja / Cleric / Frost

**The Meta Pick** - Highest sustained DPS with excellent safety.

#### Why It Works

| Sprite | Role | Key Strength |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Ninja | Main DPS | 20 cooldown = constant damage output |
| Cleric | Sustain | Keeps you alive through boss fights |
| Frost | Utility | Slowed enemies = more hits, easier kiting |

#### Detailed Strategy

**Waves 1-3: Pure Ninja Rush**
- Summon nothing but Ninjas
- Prioritize orb collection aggressively
- Goal: Reach Lv2-3 Ninja before Wave 5 boss
- Skill usage: Save everything, you shouldn't need skills yet

**Wave 4: Preparation**
- Keep building Ninjas
- If you have 25+ points, summon your first Cleric
- Position near center of map for boss spawn flexibility

**Wave 5 (First Boss):**
- Kite in large circles
- Let your Ninja stack do the work
- Skill usage: Save Dash for emergency, use Screen Blast freely
- If Full Heal drops, save it for below 40% HP

**Waves 6-10: Add Utility**
- Get Cleric to Lv2 (two Clerics = one Lv2)
- Start adding Frost once Ninja is Lv3+
- Keep one Frost at Lv1-2 for slow field coverage

**Waves 11-15: Power Spike**
- Your Ninja should be Lv4+ by now
- Lv2+ Cleric provides steady healing
- Frost keeps swarms manageable
- Boss waves: Circle kite, let DPS do the work

**Waves 16-20: Victory Push**
- Do NOT summon new Lv1 sprites (they die instantly)
- Focus all points on merging existing sprites higher
- Final boss: Use all skills aggressively, you won't need to save them

#### Skill Priority

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| Dash | Emergency escape, dodge boss attacks |
| Screen Blast | Large swarms, or anytime during boss fights |
| Full Heal | Below 30% HP, or before risky boss phase |
| Orb Magnet | Use immediately when safe, converts to more sprites |

---

### Archer / Cleric / Frost

**The Budget King** - Cheapest core, fastest power curve, safest range.

#### Why It Works

| Sprite | Role | Key Strength |
|--------|------|--------------|
| Archer | Main DPS | 10 cost = fastest merging, 200 range = safest |
| Cleric | Sustain | Essential for boss fights |
| Frost | Utility | Enemies never reach you |

#### Detailed Strategy

**Waves 1-3: Economy Advantage**
- Archer costs only 10 points (vs 15 for Ninja)
- You can summon 50% more sprites with the same points
- Rush to Lv3 Archer before anyone else can

**Wave 4: Build Lead**
- You should have Lv3 Archer already
- Start Cleric if points allow
- Your range advantage means enemies die before reaching you

**Wave 5 (First Boss):**
- Stay at max range (200 units)
- Circle the outer edge of the arena
- Boss should melt without you taking much damage

**Waves 6-10: Consolidate**
- Lv4 Archer is your goal
- Add Frost for insurance against Speedy enemies
- Cleric Lv2 for consistent healing

**Waves 11-15: Cruise Control**
- 200 range means you're shooting enemies as they spawn
- Frost slow + long range = enemies never touch you
- This is the safest comp in the game

**Waves 16-20: Clean Finish**
- Lv5 Archer with 107% bonus range is absurd
- Final boss is just a longer version of every other boss
- Keep kiting, keep shooting

#### Skill Priority

| Skill | When to Use |
|-------|-------------|
| Dash | Rarely needed due to range advantage |
| Screen Blast | Use freely, your safety margin is huge |
| Full Heal | Save for bosses, you shouldn't take much damage otherwise |
| Orb Magnet | Instant use, accelerates your already fast economy |

## A-Tier Compositions

### Wizard / Cleric / Frost

**The Chain Lightning Specialist** - Melts swarms, satisfying visuals.

#### Why It Works

- Chain lightning jumps between enemies
- One attack can hit 5+ enemies
- Frost clumps enemies together for maximum chains

#### The Drawback

- 30 cost = slow early game
- You WILL struggle waves 1-5
- Requires good kiting to survive until Lv3 Wizard

#### Strategy Summary

**Waves 1-5:** Survive. Kite constantly. Get Wizard to Lv2 minimum before first boss. Use Dash liberally.

**Waves 6-10:** Wizard Lv3 is your power spike. Add Cleric for sustain. Swarms become trivial.

**Waves 11-20:** Chain lightning clears screens. Frost keeps enemies grouped. Enjoy the light show.

---

### Bomber / Cleric / Frost

**The Explosion Enjoyer** - High burst damage, AOE on every hit.

#### Why It Works

- 25 base damage (highest in game)
- Explosions hit multiple enemies
- 180 range keeps you safe

#### The Drawback

- 35 cost = slowest merging in the game
- 120 cooldown = long gaps between attacks
- Feast or famine damage pattern

#### Strategy Summary

**Waves 1-5:** Painful. You might only have Lv1-2 Bomber by first boss. Kite hard, use all skills.

**Waves 6-10:** Bomber Lv3 starts feeling good. Explosions clear clumps. Add Cleric ASAP.

**Waves 11-20:** Lv4+ Bomber one-shots most enemies. Boss damage is excellent. Frost groups enemies for maximum explosion value.

---

### Ninja / Vampire / Frost

**The Aggressive Sustain** - Two sources of healing, high risk high reward.

#### Why It Works

- Ninja provides ranged DPS
- Vampire provides melee DPS + lifesteal (self-healing)
- No Cleric needed = more offensive power

#### The Drawback

- Vampire must be in melee range to heal
- If Vampire dies, you lose sustain
- More micro-management required

#### Strategy Summary

**Waves 1-5:** Rush Ninja as usual. Vampire is too expensive early.

**Waves 6-10:** Add Vampire once Ninja is Lv3+. Let Vampire facetank while Ninja shoots.

**Waves 11-20:** Lv3+ Vampire is nearly unkillable with lifesteal. Play aggressive, stay near your Vampire.

---

## B-Tier Compositions

### Berserker / Cleric / Frost

**Spin to Win** - High AOE burst, satisfying gameplay.

#### Why It Works

- Spin attack hits everything around the Berserker
- 20 base damage in AOE
- Frost keeps enemies in spin range

#### The Drawbacks

- 100 cooldown = long wait between spins
- Melee range = Berserker takes damage
- 20 cost = slower merging than Ninja/Archer

#### Strategy Summary

**Waves 1-5:** Build Berserker stack. Accept that you'll take more damage than ranged comps.

**Waves 6-10:** Lv3 Berserker spins hit hard. Cleric is mandatory to keep you alive.

**Waves 11-20:** Frost + Berserker = lawnmower. Enemies walk into spin and die. Fun but risky.

#### Why B-Tier?

Against bosses, the 100 cooldown kills your DPS. Bosses move, so they're often outside spin range when it finally comes off cooldown. Ninja does 2x the sustained boss damage.

---

### Knight / Cleric / Frost

**The Melee Brawler** - Pure melee chaos.

#### Why It Works

- 15 damage, 45 cooldown = decent melee DPS
- Cheap at 15 cost
- Satisfying slash attacks

#### The Drawbacks

- 40 range = must be in enemy's face
- Knights take damage constantly
- Cleric can't outheal sustained melee damage in late waves

#### Strategy Summary

Only recommended for challenge runs. You will take significantly more damage than any ranged comp.

---

## Honorable Mentions (Fun Comps)

These aren't optimal, but they're satisfying to play.

### The Zoo (One of Everything)

**Comp:** One of each sprite type

**Why It's Fun:**
- Variety of attack animations
- Feels like commanding an army
- Every fight looks different

**Why It's Bad:**
- No merging = all Lv1 sprites
- Lv1 sprites get one-shot in late waves
- You WILL lose around wave 15

**When to Play:** When you want chaos, not victory.

---

### The Frost Army

**Comp:** Pure Frost stack + one Cleric

**Why It's Fun:**
- Enemies move in slow motion
- Perma-slow the entire screen
- Very relaxing gameplay

**Why It's Bad:**
- Frost does 5 damage (lowest in game)
- Boss fights take forever
- You might time out before killing wave 20 boss

**When to Play:** When you want a chill (literally) experience.

---

### The Glass Cannon

**Comp:** Bomber / Wizard / Mage (no healer)

**Why It's Fun:**
- Maximum explosions and effects
- Screen constantly full of AOE
- When it works, it's beautiful

**Why It's Bad:**
- No sustain = one mistake and you're dead
- All three are expensive = slow start
- Boss fights are pure stress

**When to Play:** When you're feeling lucky.

---

### The Vampire Lord

**Comp:** Pure Vampire stack

**Why It's Fun:**
- Self-sustaining army of the undead
- Lifesteal means they never die (in theory)
- Aesthetic as hell

**Why It's Bad:**
- 30 cost = very slow merging
- Melee range = all your Vampires clump on one enemy
- Swarms overwhelm you before lifesteal kicks in

**When to Play:** Halloween special runs.

---

## Skill Usage Guide

### Dash (Common - 50% spawn rate)

**What it does:** Teleport in movement direction, brief invincibility

**Best uses:**
- Escape when cornered
- Dodge boss projectiles
- Cross through enemy swarms

**Pro tip:** Dash has i-frames (invincibility frames). You can dash THROUGH attacks, not just away from them.

---

### Screen Blast (Common - 40% spawn rate)

**What it does:** Damage all enemies on screen

**Best uses:**
- Clear large swarms instantly
- Burst damage during boss fights
- Emergency clear when overwhelmed

**Pro tip:** Don't hoard it. It's common enough that you'll get more. Use it whenever there are 10+ enemies on screen.

---

### Full Heal (Rare - 10% spawn rate)

**What it does:** Restore HP to maximum

**Best uses:**
- When below 30% HP
- Before a boss fight if you're damaged
- Emergency panic button

**Pro tip:** NEVER use above 50% HP. This skill is rare and should be saved for critical moments.

---

### Orb Magnet (Very Rare - 5% spawn rate)

**What it does:** Instantly collect all orbs and skill orbs on map

**Best uses:**
- Immediately when safe
- Converts to points = more sprites
- Also collects any skill orbs on the ground

**Pro tip:** Use it ASAP. The points compound into stronger sprites, and there's no benefit to holding it.

---

## General Tips

### Movement

- **Kite in circles** - Large circular paths maximize sprite attack time
- **Never corner yourself** - Always have an escape route
- **Use the entire arena** - Enemies spawn from edges, staying center gives you reaction time

### Economy

- **Orbs despawn** - Collect them before they fade
- **Early points matter most** - 10 points in wave 1 = Lv5 sprite by wave 15
- **Don't summon late game Lv1s** - They die instantly and waste points

### Merging

- **Commit to 1-2 types early** - Spreading points delays power spikes
- **Cleric + Utility after core** - Get your main DPS to Lv3 before adding support
- **Count your sprites** - Know when your next summon will trigger a merge

### Boss Fights

- **Bosses spawn wave 5, 10, 15, 20**
- **Prepare on wave 4, 9, 14, 19** - Top off your comp, position center
- **Bosses have patterns** - Learn them, don't panic
- **Wave 20 boss is just longer** - Same mechanics, more HP

---

## Final Words

The meta is ranged DPS + Cleric + Frost. But the best strategy is the one you enjoy playing.

If spinning Berserkers bring you joy, spin away. If you want to cosplay a vampire lord, go for it.

Just know that Ninja/Cleric/Frost will get you that victory screen the fastest.

Good luck, survivor.
